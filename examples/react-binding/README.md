# React binding is included in this package
## You can use react binding in-order to connect a global store to a react component's state object
## and thus keeping your components simple

On the otherhand, you do not need binding in order to use store actions in react components.
The Counter component shows a way of using the `store` keyword in order to access a globaly defined store by name.

The Controls component shows that you can access an exported store directly.
Both accessing a store directly or using its name will work either way.
